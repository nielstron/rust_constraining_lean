# lw_rust

Lean mechanisation of the core FR/lw-rust calculus from the paper.

## Improvements

This section notes down changes done to the paper that strengthen its results or otherwise were necessary for correctness.
These deviations from the paper should be kept.

- **Runtime validity is stronger than Definition 4.3.**  `ValidRuntimeState`
  contains the paper's `ValidState`, plus explicit invariants for the abstract
  store model: store owners are allocated, store owner targets are heap
  locations, heap slots have root lifetime, and term owner targets are heap
  locations.  These are implicit in the paper's intended heap-allocation model.
  The owner-cycle fact needed by assignment is derived locally from
  `ValidPartialValue.no_owned_path_to_storage`, not assumed globally.

- **Assignment follows the reference implementation, not the printed rule.**
  The assignment step reads the overwritten slot, writes the new value, and then
  drops the overwritten old value from the post-write store.  The printed
  appendix proof appears to use the wrong order in Lemma 9.6 and omits the drop
  in the assignment case of Lemma 9.8.  Conceptually, the repaired proof first
  establishes abstraction for the post-write store, then proves that dropping
  the old owner graph preserves every value still represented by the result
  environment.

- **Fresh declaration coherence is explicit.**  `T-Declare` carries
  `FreshUpdateCoherenceObligations`.  A syntactically well-formed type such as
  an empty borrow target list can still be incoherent as an environment slot, so
  the declaration rule records the missing root-transport and fresh-root facts.

- **Assignment is strengthened.**  `T-Assign` rechecks that the lhs is typeable
  after typing the rhs, requires shape compatibility and rhs well-formedness at
  the target lifetime, and carries explicit rank/coherence obligations:
  `EnvWriteRhsBorrowTargetsBelow`, `EnvWriteCoherenceObligations`, and
  `ContainedBorrowsWellFormed` for the result.  These avoid borrow cycles and
  supply the facts needed by preservation.  The result-side obligations are
  rule-carried invariants, not extra premises on the final safety statements.

- **Borrow well-formedness is preserved per target.**  Runtime borrow
  well-formedness uses `BorrowTargetsWellFormed`, which requires each target to
  be individually typeable, outlive the borrow lifetime, have a base slot that
  survives for that lifetime.  Joint target-list typing is still required where
  coherence or shape arguments need it, but it is not used as the global
  invariant: environment joins can merge target lists whose pointee types do not
  have a joint type.

- **Well-formed environments carry extra borrow invariants.**  `WellFormedEnv`
  is augmented with `Coherent` and `Linearizable`.  `Coherent` records joint
  target-list typing for contained borrows when reborrowing needs it.
  `Linearizable` comes from the follow-up material and gives a rank function
  forbidding cyclic borrow references.

- **Write fan-out requires initialized typed leaves.**  `WriteBorrowTargets`
  carries an initialized full-lvalue typing witness for each concrete fan-out
  branch.  The paper's schematic fan-out rule does not spell this out; without
  it, fan-out can reinitialize `undef` leaves and break shape preservation.

- **Positive-rank weak updates make leaf shape compatibility explicit.**
  `UpdateAtPath.weak` carries the local `ShapeCompatible` premise needed for
  shape preservation.  The paper's `update_k` weak leaf case is written over a
  full old type and relies on `T-Assign`'s shape premise; the Lean relation is
  over `PartialTy`, so the full-type/compatible-leaf assumption is stated
  directly.

- **Terminal preservation/safety is source-continuation scoped.**  Lemma 4.11
  and the terminal-safety half of Theorem 4.12 assume `SourceTerm`.  Arbitrary
  runtime constants can already contain references in unevaluated continuations;
  `SourceTerm` is therefore not derivable from typability for arbitrary
  nonempty store typings.  Source-initial empty-store theorems derive it from
  typability (`termTyping_empty_sourceTerm`), so the empty-initial Lemma 4.11
  and Theorem 4.12 wrappers have no `SourceTerm` premise.

- **`R-Declare` is an update rule; freshness is proof-side.**  The small-step
  `Step.declare` constructor updates the variable slot directly.  The freshness
  condition needed by the paper-intended declaration semantics is recovered from
  `T-Declare`, safe abstraction, and preservation.  Thus the raw reduction
  relation is broader than the typed states covered by soundness.

- **Some final wrappers expose store-typing well-formedness premises.**
  Premises such as `StoreTypingRefsWellFormed` relate runtime value typing and
  store typing to environment/lifetime well-formedness.  They are proof
  interface obligations, not extra source typing rules.

- **Theorem 4.12 assumes terminal execution.**  The paper states existence of a
  terminal run, relying on termination of the core calculus.  The mechanisation
  keeps this separate: `typeAndBorrowSafety` takes an explicit
  `TerminatesAsValue` witness and proves safety for that terminal run.  The
  nontermination-friendly component is exposed as progress.

- **Progress exposes the finite-store operational assumption.**
  `OperationalStoreProgress` packages fresh-allocation, drop, assignment, and
  lifetime-drop totality facts.  This is not intended as a theorem weakening:
  it is the Lean interface for the paper's finite/well-behaved store model, and
  is discharged by concrete finite stores.

- **General runtime safety exposes an initial borrow-safety premise.**  For
  arbitrary nonempty runtime store typings, the terminal-safety wrappers carry
  `BorrowSafeEnv` for the input environment.  Source-initial empty-store
  wrappers discharge this premise from the empty environment.
