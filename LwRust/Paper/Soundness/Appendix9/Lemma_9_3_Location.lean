# Lemma 9.3 (Location)

> Let `S` be a program store; let `Γ` be a well-formed typing environment where
> `S ∼ Γ`; let `w` be an lval and `T̃` a partial type.  If `Γ ⊢ w : T̃^m` then
> `loc(S, w)` is defined (and reads/writes through `w` are well defined).

Status: mechanized as the location-availability facts feeding
`readPreservation`/`progress`; see `lvalTyping_allocated_location` and
`readPreservation_of_location` in `LwRust.Paper.Soundness`.  The end-to-end
"read is defined and valid" packaging is Corollary 9.4 below.
