# Lemma 4.9 (Borrow Invariance)

Paper statement (Section 4.3):

> Let `S₁ ▷ t` be a valid state; let `σ` be a store typing where `S₁ ▷ t ⊢ σ`;
> let `Γ₁` be a well-formed typing environment with respect to a lifetime `l`
> where `S₁ ∼ Γ₁` and `Γ₂` be an arbitrary typing environment; let `t` be a
> term; and let `T` be a type.  If `Γ₁ ⊢ ⟨t : T⟩^l_σ ⊣ Γ₂`, then `Γ₂[γ ↦ T^l]`
> is well-formed with respect to `l` for arbitrary `γ ∈ fresh`.

Status: the core output-environment statement is proved.  The mutable-borrow
fan-out facts needed by Definition 3.23 are carried by the strengthened write
rules and appendix helper lemmas, not by the named Lemma 4.9 wrapper.

The borrow invariant is now mechanised **faithfully per target** (Definition
4.8(i): each individual target lval `w` of a contained borrow is typable with
`m ≼ n`), as opposed to the earlier — and unsound — joint target-list typing
`Γ ⊢ ū : ⟨T⟩^m` (Definition 3.21, which belongs to the well-formed *type*
judgement established at borrow creation by `T-LvBor`, not to the runtime
invariant).  This was the root cause that blocked the environment-join case: rule
W-Bor merges the target *lists* of two joined borrows without joining their
pointee types, so the merged list has no joint typing in general, yet each target
keeps its own per-target typing.  With the per-target statement:

* the previously **false** obligation `partialTyUnion_preserves_borrows` is now a
  theorem (`PartialTyBorrowsWellFormedInSlot.of_partialTyUnion`);
* the borrow-target join transport uses the single-lval
  `FullLValTypingJoinTransport` (no joint cons-union landmark);
* the single-lval determinism keystone `lvalTyping_eqv`/`lvalTyping_sameShape`
  (from the linearizability rank φ) is fully proven and unconditional.

The old artificial final result-extension form is kept only in explicitly named
compatibility helpers; the paper-facing wrapper below states the core `Γ₂`
invariant directly.

Runtime-grounded borrow safety: the store is realised by *some* borrow-safe
environment `envBS` that same-shape-strengthens the (possibly join-merged, hence
borrow-unsafe) typing environment `env`.

Because strengthening preserves the mutable bit and the shape (W-Bor), `envBS`
pins down the real per-borrow mutabilities — unlike a bare
`∃ env, store ∼ₛ env ∧ BorrowSafeEnv env`, which is vacuous (V-Borrow leaves
`mutable` free, so the runtime store alone cannot witness borrow safety).

This is the invariant threaded by preservation in place of static
`BorrowSafeEnv env`: after a `T-If` join the typing env is `env₅` (unsafe) but
the runtime store still realises the executed branch's borrow-safe `env₃`. -/

/-- The `&mut` *location-exclusivity* invariant of the executed-branch store
across a `T-If` join (`store ∼ₛ env₃`, `env₅ = env₃ ⊔ env₄`).

Read off the realized env₃ store: whenever an env₅ borrow node at root `x`
*selects* (`SelectedTarget store x s`) a target `s` reaching some location, and
the realized branch env₃ *also* selects, at the same root `x`, a target `t₃`
reaching the *same* location (`store.loc t₃ = store.loc s`), then the two borrow
nodes carry the same mutability bit.

This is the honest store-level invariant the §4.5.1 ite-join deviation needs:
at most one *live* `&mut` borrow reaches any given location, so a runtime cell
that co-resolves an env₄-only join target `s` and an env₃ target `t₃` cannot
disagree on `&mut`-ness — the mutability reaching a location is a function of the
location, not of which branch's target names it.  Crucially it is purely a
property of the realized store plus which targets are `&mut` (read off env₃ and
the join), so it is *invariant under the type-level ite join*: the join never
touches the store, and W-Bor preserves the mutable bit. -/
def LocMutExcl (store : ProgramStore) (env₃ env₅ : Env) : Prop :=
  ∀ x mutable targets s,
    env₅ ⊢ x ↝ (.borrow mutable targets) → s ∈ targets → SelectedTarget store x s →
    ∀ mutable₃ targets₃ t₃,
      env₃ ⊢ x ↝ (.borrow mutable₃ targets₃) → t₃ ∈ targets₃ →
      SelectedTarget store x t₃ →
      store.loc t₃ = store.loc s →
      mutable₃ = mutable

/-- The keystone `T-If` join `hlive` side condition, now premise-clean modulo the
honest store-level `&mut` location-exclusivity invariant `LocMutExcl` (replacing
the opaque `hbridge`).

The keep-contract is stated as **location coverage**: the witness `env_w`'s
`x`-borrow keeps, at the *same location*, *some* target `t_w` co-resolving with
the selected env₅ target `s` (`store.loc t_w = store.loc s`).  This is the
correct contract for the §4.5.1 deviation — an env₄-only join target `s` is not
syntactically in the env₃-derived witness, but the env₃ target `t₃` it
co-resolves with *is* kept, and `LocMutExcl` pins the two nodes to the same
mutability so the kept node has the env₅ borrow's mutable bit.

* (A) env₃ side: `s` is a genuine env₃ target → `hkept₃` keeps it directly.
* (B) env₄-only side: the realized store selects `s` (`hsel`); the realization
  bridge `envBorrow_of_selectedTarget` recovers a genuine env₃ node at `x` with
  a *co-located* realized target `t₃`; `LocMutExcl` makes that node's mutability
  the env₅ borrow's, and `hkept₃` keeps `t₃` at `s`'s location. -/

  Proof-side selector invariant for writes through a typed lvalue path.

  `PathSelected env pt path selectedName selectedSlot selectedTy` says that
  following `path` from partial type `pt` eventually dereferences a mutable
  borrow branch whose selected target is the variable `selectedName`.  The
  invariant is derived from `LValTyping`/`LValTargetsTyping`; it is not an
  additional typing-rule premise.

The exact well-formedness invariant needed for runtime references in `T-Const`.

The `T-Copy` result type is well formed.

This is intentionally specialized by `copy(T)`: copyable types are only `int`
and immutable borrows, so we do not need a false theorem saying every full type
read from an lval is recursively well formed.

Move Preservation for well-formed environments, used in Lemma 4.9.

This is the proof obligation described in the `T-Move` case of the paper:
`move(Γ, w)` replaces the moved component by `undef`, and the
`¬writeProhibited(Γ, w)` premise prevents this from invalidating any surviving

Appendix Lemma 9.5 target-stability fragment.

If an lval is typed in a well-formed block body, its base slot survives the
enclosing parent lifetime, and the reached location also lives at the parent
side, then dropping the immediate child lifetime preserves the lval typing.

Lemma 4.9 well-formedness induction for source terms.

Source terms contain no reference values, so the store-typing
reference-well-formedness premise of
`typingPreservesWellFormed_of_ruleCarriedObligations` is not needed: the
typing derivation factors through the empty store typing
(`TermTyping.retype_of_sourceTerm`), whose reference invariant is trivial.

/-- Owned-dereference `move` multistep preservation.

This is the non-empty owner-spine case of the paper's `R-Move` preservation
argument.  The source lvalue denotes a box slot, so moving `*source` writes
`undef` to the owned leaf while the environment move strikes the same leaf in the
base variable's partial type.

Dropping values that are not owned anywhere in the store preserves safe
abstraction for the same environment.

This is the post-write cleanup part of assignment preservation.  Domain
agreement is preserved because heap-only owner targets cannot delete variable
slots; value validity is preserved because every owner reached by an
environment value is disjoint from the dropped owners, and every borrow
dependency is protected from the orphaned drop set.

GRAPH LEMMA B — the overwritten value's owners are orphaned by the write.

After `value` is written through `*source`, the locations owned by the old
contents `oldSlot.value` are no longer owned by any slot of `writtenStore`: by
single-owner uniqueness (`ValidStore`) their unique owner *was* the slot at
`lhsLocation`, which the write has just overwritten.  This is the ownership-graph
fact that lets the subsequent `Drops` re-establish `StoreOwnersAllocated` via
`drops_storeOwnersAllocated_of_disjoint`.

/-! ### Location order for borrow-resolution chains (Appendix 9.6 support)

Lval resolution follows stored references.  Owner edges stay inside one
single-owner tree, while a borrow jump moves to the resolution of a
runtime-selected borrow target whose base ranks strictly below the current
tree's root variable.  This induces a strict order on resolved locations: a
typed lval can never read the location it resolves to, and nothing resolves
through a location from "at or below" it.

Intrinsic root view of a resolved location: the location lies in the owner
tree of a root variable ranked at most the lval's base, and its slot carries a
valid typed view whose borrow-target variables rank strictly below that root.

The view follows the runtime resolution: owner edges descend within the root's
slot type, while every borrow jump re-enters at a target whose base ranks
strictly below the current root.

/-! ### Guarded-base chase

Resolving into (or reading from) a guard-protected owner tree forces the
resolving lvalue's base into the guard set, provided the guard set absorbs the
container of any borrow node that targets a guarded base.  At the assignment
use-site the guard set is the write's authority chain and absorption is exactly
borrow safety (`BorrowSafeEnv`) against the chain's mutable-borrow records.

/-! ### The write's authority guard (Appendix 9.6 deref-assign support)

The deref-assignment's authority chain: starting from the written base, the
bases of the targets of guarded mutable-borrow nodes.  Memberships carry the
container's dependency kill, so borrow safety collapses any observer with a
dependency inside the written tree onto a member whose kill refutes it.
-/

/-- The slot variable's stored value has no borrow-resolution dependency on
the written location. -/
def SlotDepKill (store : ProgramStore) (env : Env) (leaf : Location)
    (z : Name) : Prop :=
  ∀ zslot value,
    env.slotAt z = some zslot →
    store.slotAt (VariableProjection z) =
      some { value := value, lifetime := zslot.lifetime } →
    ¬ RuntimeFrame.BorrowDependency store value zslot.ty leaf

/-- **Location-based `&mut` leaf exclusivity.**

The honest store-level runtime invariant that discharges the deref-write frame's
cross-variable kill obligation *pointwise*, replacing the `collapse_kill` /
`BorrowSafeWitness` borrow-graph chase.

`MutLeafExclusive store env owner leaf` says: `leaf` is the runtime location a
live `&mut` (held by the lval `owner`) currently points to, and *no other*
variable's stored borrow resolves through it.  Concretely, for every variable
`z` distinct from `owner`'s base, `z`'s stored value carries **no** borrow
dependency reading `leaf` (`SlotDepKill store env leaf z`) — `z`'s borrow
back-edges never resolve through the written `&mut` leaf.

This is exactly the missing fact pinned down by "angle C": the `LocationBelow`
cycle in the deref-assign kill closes its DOWN direction for any borrow target
(`locReads_below`) but its UP direction only for `owner` itself (the firstNode,
whose deref chain *is* the write chain).  For a cross-variable `z` the UP
direction is unavailable, and the only contradiction is that `z` must not read
the written `&mut` leaf at all — i.e. `SlotDepKill` for that `z`.

`BorrowDependency` (hence `SlotDepKill`) is defined through `LocReads` and
`store.loc`, so this is a genuinely location-based store/env-level invariant —
keyed on actual store locations and realized pointees, never on a syntactic
merged target list — and the `T-If` join therefore preserves it for free.  The
owner's *own* dependency through `leaf` is handled separately by location
well-foundedness (`slotDepKill_of_firstNode`), so `MutLeafExclusive` only
constrains the genuinely cross-variable aliases. -/
def MutLeafExclusive (store : ProgramStore) (env : Env) (owner : LVal)
    (leaf : Location) : Prop :=
  ∀ z, z ≠ LVal.base owner → SlotDepKill store env leaf z

/-- **The general store/env-level `&mut`-exclusivity invariant.**

`MutBorrowsExclusive store env` is the write-agnostic invariant threaded through
preservation that discharges the deref-write frame's `MutLeafExclusive`
obligation.  It says: every live mutable borrow's runtime pointee location is
*exclusive* — no other variable's stored borrow resolves through it.

Concretely, for every lval `source` whose env type is `&mut targets` and whose
dereference resolves at runtime to a leaf location `leaf`
(`store.loc (.deref source) = some leaf`), the leaf is `MutLeafExclusive`: no
cross-variable borrow back-edge carries a `BorrowDependency` reading `leaf`.

This is a genuinely store-level / location-based invariant (keyed on
`store.loc` and `BorrowDependency`, never on a syntactic merged target list), so
the `T-If` *join* preserves it for free — the post-`ite` store is the executed
branch's store and `&mut`-ness is store-keyed.  Its real preservation crux is
straight-line borrow creation (`x = &mut y`), discharged by the borrow rule's
write-prohibition check. -/

/-! ### Realized-witness `&mut` leaf exclusivity (join-trivial reformulation)

The `MutLeafExclusive`/`SlotDepKill` family above is keyed on
`RuntimeFrame.BorrowDependency store value zslot.ty leaf`, which reads `zslot.ty`
(the env type) — so it is ANTI-MONOTONE under the W-Bor target-list union and the
`T-If` join coarsens it, making establishment at the join impossible (the
§4.5.1 deviation, verified in Lean over many runs).

`RuntimeFrame.RealizedBorrowReads` (Frame.lean) is the TYPE-FREE realization: it
follows only the borrow target that resolves to the stored reference's OWN pointee
location, never a static target-list member.  Keying the kill on it removes the
env-type from the conclusion entirely, so the invariant below is invariant under
any env coarsening and the `T-If` join preserves it for free (the post-join store
is the executed branch's store). -/

/-- Type-free, store-realized version of `SlotDepKill`: variable `z`'s stored
value carries no *realized* borrow read of `leaf`.  Reads `env` only for the slot
lifetime (a store-realized quantity); the stored value's TYPE is never inspected,
so this predicate is unchanged by any env-type coarsening. -/

witness environment `env_w` that the store realises (`store ∼ₛ env_w`), that is
genuinely borrow safe, and that *keeps every resolvable target* of `env`'s

on `WriteGuarded.step`), the witness's borrow safety replaces the static `env`'s

*selected* by the root variable `x` that owns the dependency-bearing cell: every
cell crossed by the borrow-resolution descent is owned by `x` (the descent only
follows owning boxes), so the leaf borrow cell holding the reference to the
target's location is `ProtectedByBase store x`.  This is exactly the
